//*      TCP/IP NPF(Network Print Facility) is a free feature       *   FILE 621
//*      of OS/390 and z/OS. It can print JES and VTAM data to      *   FILE 621
//*      network printers via TCP/IP printer servers(LPD            *   FILE 621
//*      servers).                                                  *   FILE 621
//*                                                                 *   FILE 621
//*      NPF provides three different exit interfaces. Here I       *   FILE 621
//*      created one of them: Input Record Exit. The Input          *   FILE 621
//*      Record Exit is used to insert a banner page, update        *   FILE 621
//*      the input record.                                          *   FILE 621
//*                                                                 *   FILE 621
//*      Normallly, NPF uses LPR program to send data to remote     *   FILE 621
//*      printer servers. However, for those printer without        *   FILE 621
//*      Postscript support features, you cannot print your         *   FILE 621
//*      data sets in landscape via LPR.                            *   FILE 621
