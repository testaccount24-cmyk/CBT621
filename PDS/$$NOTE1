Hi Sam,

I have designed some TCP/IP NPF Exit Programs to print mainframe
datasets directly to any network printer with PCL language support.
Most laser printers support PCL, such as HP, Xerox, Canon, Lexmark.
The program will also generate a banner page to identify the
sender.


If these programs can be accepted in CBT Tape, I would send them
via FTP. Please help to reply.

Best Regards!
